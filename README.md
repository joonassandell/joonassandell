# Hi ðŸ‘‹ 

Iâ€™m Joonas â€” [Creative developer](https://joonassandell.com), [designer](https://joonassandell.com) and sometimes even a [music producer](https://soundcloud.com/modeapart) based in Helsinki, Finland. I'm currently working for 
[Biocode](https://biocode.io).

I have a strong passion for all aspects of product, UI/UX and visual design, including web and mobile services, branding and software development. I love designing in the browser but I work a lot with Figma and other design tools as well. I like writing applications mainly with TypeScript, React and other modern tools.

With more than a decade of experience in the design and software industry, I have the skills to assist clients in addressing practical business challenges. 

Check out my [portfolio](https://joonassandell.com) for selected works and [Dribbble](https://dribbble.com/joonassandell) for latest sketches.
