# Hi ðŸ‘‹ 

Iâ€™m Joonas â€” Creative developer and designer based in Helsinki, Finland. I'm currently working for [Biocode](https://biocode.io).

I have a strong passion for all aspects of product, UI/UX and visual design, including web and mobile services, branding and software development. I love designing in the browser but I work a lot with Figma and other design tools as well. I like writing applications mainly with TypeScript, React and other modern tools.
