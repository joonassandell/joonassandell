# Hi ðŸ‘‹

Iâ€™m Joonas â€” Front-end Developer, UI/UX Designer and sometimes even a [Music Producer](https://soundcloud.com/modeapart) based in Helsinki, Finland. I'm currently working for [Freepress](https://freepress.ai). I have a strong and great visual taste, broad understanding of front-end web technologies and a genuine passion for all aspects of product and visual design, including web services, design systems, touch platforms and branding.

I get excited about finding unique and elegant solutions for complex user issues, and I love designing by code in the browser but I work a lot with _Figma_ and other design tools as well. Usually I prefer writing applications with _TypeScript_, _React_, _Sass_ and other modern tools.

Check out my **[Portfolio](https://joonassandell.com)** ([view source](https://github.com/joonassandell/portfolio)) for selected works.
