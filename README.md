# Hi ðŸ‘‹

Iâ€™m Joonas â€” UI/UX Designer, Front-end Developer and sometimes even a [Music Producer](https://soundcloud.com/modeapart), currently working on [Freepress](https://freepress.ai). I have a strong and great visual taste and my field of interests is quite extensive, ranging from product design to creative coding and web development, branding, and design systems.

I get excited about finding unique and elegant solutions for complex user issues, and I love designing in the browser but I work a lot with _Figma_ and other design tools as well. Usually I prefer writing applications with _TypeScript_, _React_, _Sass_ and other modern tools.

Check out my **[Portfolio](https://joonassandell.com)** ([view source](https://github.com/joonassandell/portfolio)) for selected works.
